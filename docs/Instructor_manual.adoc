# Instructor Manual

Agenda

1. Welcome participants etc.
2. Verify everybody followed the instructions and has the app running, REPL connected, Fulcro Inspect open
3. Present link:./INTRO.md[INTRO] or link:./INTRO-non-clojurians.md[INTRO-non-clojurians] (which starts with the workshop agenda)
4. Post to the chat:
+
> Here are two links you will need to have opened https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-intro-wshop/blob/main/docs/INTRO.md and  https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-intro-wshop/blob/main/docs/Workshop.adoc
5. Give a tour of the recommended window setup and fly through the Fulcro Inspect tabs that we will use
6. Ask them to post *finished ex. number* such as 1 .. 9 to the chat so that you have an overview of the progress
7. Let them follow link:./Workshop.adoc[] while doing the exercises on the screen (not expecting them to watch, just for the recording and to pass time :))

## Before workshop

Run the app via GitPod to verify that it still works and to get GitPod to build (and hopefully cache) the image for faster startup for the participants.

## Tips

Use Discord and create a _room_ for each exercises where participants could discuss and help each other.
